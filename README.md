##### This is the respository for my portfolio website that can be found at cskonopka.com. The website is built with React and Semantic-UI using Node.JS as the backend framework. I made the website public to keep track of my own changes and to also demonstrate how to create somewhat minimal portfolio website for curious individuals. All questions welcomed!

###### Run

###### Build
